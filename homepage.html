    <h1>Is the Ease in Government Monitoring as Society Becomes More Automated a Good or Bad Thing?</h1>
    <p>As society and technology becomes more advanced, surveillance and government monitoring will increase significantly. 
      The ease in monitoring of citizens can be both a good and bad thing, and there are many mixed opinions about it. 
      Overall, there are too many nuances in opinions to clearly define it as “good” or “bad”. Here’s why:</p>

    <h2>How Government Monitoring Can Be Positive for Society</h2>
    <p>Because there are mixed opinions on this topic, there are advantages and drawbacks to it. Some potential benefits for an ease of access in government monitoring is enhanced security. 
      This means that governments can use advanced technology to detect, prevent, and reduce crimes effectively. 
      With more advanced security and surveillance measures, criminals may think twice about commiting a crime, which can decrease crime rates. 
      Another benefit is overall efficiency in law enforcement and services. Responses to emergencies will quicken, while local management can improve. For example, traffic can be prevented, and problems that occur will be seen faster. 
      Another good thing about this is the fact that surveillance can make public spaces safer. Not only will in-person places be safe, but social media and other online platforms can be regulated to prevent misinformation and harmful content. 
      Another bonus is that physical security (guards) for businesses can be potentially removed which can save money for businesses.</p>
