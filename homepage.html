    <h1>Is the Ease in Government Monitoring as Society Becomes More Automated a Good or Bad Thing?</h1>
    <p>As society and technology becomes more advanced, surveillance and government monitoring will increase significantly. 
      The ease in monitoring of citizens can be both a good and bad thing, and there are many mixed opinions about it. 
      Overall, there are too many nuances in opinions to clearly define it as “good” or “bad”. Here’s why:</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How Government Monitoring Can Be Positive for Society</h2>
    <p>Because there are mixed opinions on this topic, there are advantages and drawbacks to it. Some potential benefits for an ease of access in government monitoring is enhanced security. 
      This means that governments can use advanced technology to detect, prevent, and reduce crimes effectively. 
      With more advanced security and surveillance measures, criminals may think twice about commiting a crime, which can decrease crime rates. 
      Another benefit is overall efficiency in law enforcement and services. Responses to emergencies will quicken, while local management can improve. For example, traffic can be prevented, and problems that occur will be seen faster. 
      Another good thing about this is the fact that surveillance can make public spaces safer. Not only will in-person places be safe, but social media and other online platforms can be regulated to prevent misinformation and harmful content. 
      Another bonus is that physical security (guards) for businesses can be potentially removed which can save money for businesses.</p>
    <h2>How Government Monitoring Can Be Detrimental for Society</h2>
    <p>Even though there are benefits to the ease of government monitoring, there are disadvantages too. One big concern for many people is the violation of privacy online and in-person. 
      With advanced surveillance, people may feel like they are always being watched and feel less free. Another disadvantage to this technology is that it gives the government and big organizations the potential to abuse it. 
      For example, it might be used to target political opponents, or to control the public, which is not democratic. Additionally, in terms of automated surveillance, there may be groups of people subject to bias, especially when using AI. 
      In general, the major downside to government monitoring is the possible effect on society which limits people's freedom, behavior and creativity.</p>
    <h2>Facial Recognition</h2>
    <p>An important part of government monitoring and surveillance today and in the future is facial recognition. There have been many businesses that have developed such technology, like Clearview and Amazon. 
      Clearview developed and gives its AI to law enforcement for investigations. According to Clearview, their AI is precise, proven, scalable, and secure. They also claim that its accuracy is 99+%. 
      They have over 50 billion images in their database for law enforcement, which can be reassuring or concerning for some people. 
      On the other hand, Amazon’s facial recognition, Rekognition, received backlash in 2020 because of AI bias while selling its facial recognition to the police. 
      Amazon’s Rekognition was used for “people of interest”, and according to a 2019 study, Amazon had the worst accuracy in gender classification with the false matches being people of color. 
      Amazon tried discrediting the study, but it backfired, as over 80 AI researchers defended the study. Eventually, Amazon stopped selling the tech to the police. 
      This can be a big privacy concern, as they have billions of images of people’s faces, and can track down or identify almost anybody. 
      Not only can it be a privacy concern, but it can be very biased like what happened with Amazon, and certain groups can be targeted.</p>
